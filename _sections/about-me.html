<p>After graduating from Stanford Universtiy, I worked with Silicon Valley startups in different sectors (e.g. clean energy, water sports, travel, social media, consumer electronics, and more). I optimized their marketing funnels, maximized customer experience, and boosted conversions. 

Using a data-first approach, I look for the best ways to bring value to your business which includes

<ul>
  <li>Paid Marketing</li>
  <li>SEO</li>
  <li>Product Management</li>
  <li>Data Analysis</li>
  <li>Product Validation</li>
  <li>UI/UX</li>
</ul>  

At the end of the day, it's all about improving the bottom line. Contact me, if you would like to know the best way to improve your bottom line.
